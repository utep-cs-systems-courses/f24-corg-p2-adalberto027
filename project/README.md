First, run "make all" in the project directory. After that, navigate to the toy directory and execute "make load" to upload the program to the MSP430 board.

### Redesigned Functionality:
1. Button 1: Activates a "pulse fade" effect on the green LED, where it gradually brightens and dims.
2. Button 2: Plays a short melody of three descending notes (e.g., DO, SI, LA) with increasing speed on subsequent presses.
3. Button 3: Alternates between red and green LEDs flashing in an irregular pattern.
4. Button 4: Engages a "light-off" sequence where both LEDs blink three times before turning off completely.

### Compilation and Usage:
- Compile: Run "make all" from the main project directory.
- Load: Navigate to the "toy" directory and run "make load".
- Use: Interact with the buttons to explore the unique functionalities.
